- I need a prompt from you for claude-code:
1. do not disable existing modules, instead just mention known issues and prompt to search for solutions to thos problems, without disabling modules
2. no need to run local vercel commands since my github pr automatically deploys on vercel
3. i need the nuxt/content module to work, so formulate a prompt that will aim for exactly that (if possible mention known gh issues and refernce them, same for official documentation of the used modules)

Give me this prompt now.
