# Understanding Vue Composition API

The Vue Composition API is one of the most significant additions to Vue 3. It provides a new way to organize and reuse logic in Vue components, offering better TypeScript support and improved code organization.

## Why Composition API?

While the Options API is still fully supported and recommended for many use cases, the Composition API offers several advantages:

- **Better logic reuse** - Share stateful logic between components
- **Improved TypeScript support** - Better type inference
- **More flexible code organization** - Group related logic together
- **Better performance** - Reduced overhead in component creation

## Basic Example

Here's a simple example of using the Composition API:

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref, computed, onMounted } from 'vue'

// Reactive state
const count = ref(0)
const name = ref('Vue')

// Computed properties
const doubleCount = computed(() => count.value * 2)

// Methods
function increment() {
  count.value++
}

// Lifecycle hooks
onMounted(() => {
  console.log('Component mounted!')
})
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Hello {{ name }}!</h1>
    <p>Count: {{ count }}</p>
    <p>Double: {{ doubleCount }}</p>
    <button @click="increment">Increment</button>
  </div>
</template>
```

## Key Concepts

### Reactivity

The Composition API uses `ref()` and `reactive()` to create reactive data:

```javascript
import { ref, reactive } from 'vue'

// ref for primitives
const count = ref(0)
const message = ref('Hello')

// reactive for objects
const state = reactive({
  user: {
    name: 'John',
    email: 'john@example.com'
  }
})
```

### Composables

One of the most powerful features is the ability to create composables - reusable functions that encapsulate stateful logic:

```javascript
// composables/useCounter.js
import { ref } from 'vue'

export function useCounter(initialValue = 0) {
  const count = ref(initialValue)
  
  function increment() {
    count.value++
  }
  
  function decrement() {
    count.value--
  }
  
  return {
    count,
    increment,
    decrement
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use `<script setup>`** - It's more concise and has better performance
2. **Create composables for reusable logic** - Don't repeat yourself
3. **Keep reactive state minimal** - Only make data reactive when necessary
4. **Use computed for derived state** - Better performance than watchers in most cases

## Conclusion

The Composition API is a powerful addition to Vue 3 that enables better code organization and reusability. While it has a learning curve, the benefits in terms of maintainability and TypeScript support make it worth the effort.

Start small by converting a few components to use the Composition API, and gradually adopt it throughout your application as you become more comfortable with the concepts.
