# Getting Started with Nuxt.js

Nuxt.js is a powerful framework built on top of Vue.js that makes building modern web applications a breeze. In this guide, we'll explore the fundamentals of Nuxt.js and help you get started with your first project.

## What is Nuxt.js?

Nuxt.js is a free and open-source framework that provides a higher-level abstraction on top of Vue.js. It simplifies the development of universal or single-page Vue applications by providing:

- Server-side rendering (SSR)
- Static site generation (SSG)
- Automatic code splitting
- File-based routing system
- Built-in SEO optimization

## Key Features

### 1. File-based Routing

One of the most convenient features of Nuxt.js is its automatic routing system. You simply create Vue files in the `pages/` directory, and Nuxt automatically generates the corresponding routes.

### 2. Server-Side Rendering

Nuxt.js provides excellent SSR capabilities out of the box, which means better SEO and faster initial page loads for your users.

### 3. Static Site Generation

With Nuxt's generate command, you can create static websites that can be deployed on any static hosting service.

## Getting Started

To create a new Nuxt.js project, you can use the following command:

```bash
npx nuxi@latest init my-nuxt-app
cd my-nuxt-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will create a new Nuxt.js project and start the development server.

## Conclusion

Nuxt.js is an excellent choice for building modern web applications with Vue.js. Its powerful features and excellent developer experience make it a popular choice among developers worldwide.
