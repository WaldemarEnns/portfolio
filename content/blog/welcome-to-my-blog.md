Hey, I'm Waldemar! 👋

Thanks for stopping by. This blog isn't just a collection of tech tutorials—it's my digital living room where I share what I've learned over 7+ years as a software developer, freelancer, and consultant based in Germany.

Whether you're here to learn, looking for a development partner, or just curious about modern web tech—I'm glad you found your way here.

## Who's behind this?

I'm the guy who transforms complex business problems into elegant code solutions. But honestly? I'm primarily a problem-solver with a passion for clean code and genuine partnerships.

My journey into development wasn't a straight line. Like many developers, I started with curiosity and a lot of trial and error. What began as tinkering with websites quickly evolved into a deep passion for building software that actually makes a difference. Over the past 7+ years, I've had the privilege of working with companies across various industries—from startups launching their first product to established businesses looking to modernize their digital presence.

My journey started with a simple belief: **technology should help people, not confuse them.** That's why I don't just work "for" clients—I work *with* them. I want to understand what your business truly needs before writing the first line of code.

## My Tech Stack

Over the years, I've developed deep expertise in a modern, powerful stack that lets me build everything from sleek marketing sites to complex SaaS platforms:

**Frontend & User Experience**
- **Vue.js & Nuxt** – My go-to framework for building fast, SEO-friendly applications. The Vue ecosystem is incredibly productive, and Nuxt takes it to the next level with server-side rendering and an amazing developer experience.
- **TypeScript** – Because catching errors at compile time beats debugging them in production. Type safety isn't just a nice-to-have; it's essential for maintainable code.

**Backend & APIs**
- **Laravel** – When I need a robust backend, Laravel delivers. It's perfect for SaaS applications, booking systems, inventory management, and API development. The ecosystem is mature, well-documented, and a joy to work with.
- **NestJS** – For more complex, enterprise-grade applications requiring microservices architecture or GraphQL APIs.
- **Python** – Great for data processing, automation scripts, and when I need to integrate machine learning capabilities.

**Infrastructure & DevOps**
- **CI/CD** – Automated testing and deployment through GitHub Actions and GitLab CI. I don't believe in "it works on my machine."
- **Cloud Hosting** – Whether it's Vercel, Netlify, or traditional VPS setups, I ensure your application is fast, secure, and scalable.

## The AI Revolution

I'll admit it: I'm genuinely excited about AI-assisted development. Not because it's trendy, but because I've seen it transform my own workflow. That's why I offer workshops on **Agentic Coding**—because I firmly believe AI tools like Cursor, Claude Code, and Opencode can (and should!) revolutionize how we work.

These aren't just fancy autocomplete tools. When used correctly, they can:
- Accelerate development by 10x
- Help you write better, more consistent code
- Handle the boilerplate so you can focus on architecture and problem-solving
- Make debugging and refactoring less painful

I've trained 50+ developers on these tools, and the feedback has been incredible. If you're curious about integrating AI into your development workflow, [check out my workshops](/#workshops) or drop me a message.

## How I Work

**Testing is Non-Negotiable**
I rarely skip testing—it's a fundamental part of my development process. Unit tests with TDD, component tests with Cypress, and E2E tests to verify the complete user journey. This ensures the code is robust from day one and makes future changes less risky.

**Agile & Adaptive**
I apply agile methods like SCRUM, Kanban, or Scrumban to stay flexible and incorporate regular feedback. Through short iterations and weekly check-ins, I ensure requirements stay current and actionable. No surprises at the end of the project.

**Clean Code & Git Flow**
I work with a mix of Git Flow and GitHub Flow, ensuring well-structured branches whether we're in a long-term development cycle or need quick iterations. Regular rebasing, clear commit messages, and thorough code reviews keep the codebase clean and traceable.

**Communication Over Jargon**
I believe in clear, regular updates. You'll always know where your project stands and what's coming next. No technical jargon, no vague status reports—just honest progress updates and direct access when you need it.

## What to Expect from This Blog

This blog will be my space to share:

**🚀 Practical Insights**
Real lessons learned from projects—not just the successes, but also the "oops, should've done that differently" moments. From Vue.js and Nuxt to Laravel and Python backend solutions. I'll share code snippets, architectural decisions, and the reasoning behind them.

**🤖 AI & The Future of Coding**
Deep dives into AI-assisted development. How to set up Cursor, Claude Code, and Opencode for maximum productivity. Prompt engineering techniques that actually work. Best practices for integrating AI into your team's workflow.

**💡 Thoughts Beyond Code**
Agile methods that actually work in the real world. Why testing isn't just a checkbox. How to communicate technical projects so stakeholders understand what's happening. The soft skills that make good developers great.

**🌍 Industry Perspectives**
Observations on where web development is heading. Reviews of new tools and frameworks. Honest opinions on tech trends (the good, the bad, and the overhyped).

## My Promise

No tech jargon. No superficial "hello world" tutorials. No rehashed documentation.

Just honest insights into the world of modern web development—with all its challenges and opportunities. I believe in code that grows with you. In partnerships that last beyond project completion. And that the best technology is the one that truly moves your business forward.

When you work with me, you get more than a developer. You get a strategic partner who understands that technology is a means to an end—not the end itself. Someone who asks "why" before "how" and cares about your success as much as you do.
